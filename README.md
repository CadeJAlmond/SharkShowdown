# Overview SharkShowdown
A cool biological, graphing simulator with html, css and js. This project 
is a website which provides a form which can take input from the user and 
construct a graph recording the populations of sharks and minnow over a 
provided amount of years. Each simulation ran will also provide statistics
to the UI which can inform the user about the simulation. The UI consists
of a hero page, graph / form section, tabs for statistics and lastly a 
footer.
